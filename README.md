MBRW_synthetic_clickstream_generator
====================================
Memory Biased Random Walk (MBRW) model is taking real clickstream data in sparse AML format
and generating synthetic clickstream data that conform to statistical properties of the real
data, while, at the same time, adhering to the privacy protection policies.

In our work [1], we show that synthetic clickstreams can be used to learn recommender system
models which achieve high recommender performance on real data and at the same time strong
de-minimization guarantees can be provided.

This code can be run by Matlab (tested in 2011 version).
